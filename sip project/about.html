                Ayurveda blends our modern lifestyle and health-oriented habits with the ancient wisdom of using natural
                substances, medicines and herbs to help us lead a healthy, happy, stress-free and disease-free life. ...
                The cardinal aim of Ayurveda is to restore the individual balance between mind, body and spirit.

                For most of people, Ayurveda is just another way of treating illnesses with medicines that are made up
                of herbs. Well, For me Ayurveda is much much more than that and today, As my experience in life and my
                own believe for me Ayurveda is Life, its Energy which inspired me.

                So about Ayurveda-



                Ayurveda is the Upaveda (sub or near to veda) of Atharva veda. It’s also called Panchama veda (5th
                veda). The word Ayurveda is made of two words Ayu and Veda. The word Ayu doesn’t mean just life, instead
                it means –

                शरीरेन्द्रिय सत्वात्मा संयोगो। – चरक संहिता १।४२

                śarīrendriya satvātmā saṃyogo।1.42

                The union of Shareera (body), Indriya (sense organs), Satva (mind) and Atma (soul).

                and Veda means knowledge. Hence, Ayurveda means the knowledge of the union of body, sense organs, mind
                and soul. So when people bless saying ‘दीर्घायुषी भव।’ (dīrghāyuṣī bhava।) it means let you be in union
                with all the above factors for a long time!



                स्वस्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणं, आतुरस्य विकार प्रशमनं। (चरक संहित सूत्र ३०।२६)

                svasthasya svāsthya rakṣaṇaṃ, āturasya vikāra praśamanaṃ। (Caraka Saṃhita Sūtra 30।26)

                Ayurveda Shastra aims at keeping a healthy person healthy and managing or curing diseases (mind, body or
                both) that manifest in a person.

                Ayurveda (/ˌɑːjʊərˈveɪdə, -ˈviː-/)[1] is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the
                Indian subcontinent.[2] The theory and practice of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific.[3][4][5] Ayurveda is
                heavily practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using it.[6][7][8]

                Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.[2] Therapies include herbal
                medicines, special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils.[9][10]
                Ayurvedic preparations are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances
                (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or rasashastra). Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught
                surgical techniques, including rhinoplasty, kidney stone extractions, sutures, and the extraction of
                foreign objects.[11][12]

                The main classical Ayurveda texts begin with accounts of the transmission of medical knowledge from the
                gods to sages, and then to human physicians.[13] Printed editions of the Sushruta Samhita (Sushruta's
                Compendium), frame the work as the teachings of Dhanvantari, Hindu god of Ayurveda, incarnated as King
                Divodāsa of Varanasi, to a group of physicians, including Sushruta.[14][15] The oldest manuscripts of
                the work, however, omit this frame, ascribing the work directly to King Divodāsa.[16] Through
                well-understood processes of modernization and globalization, Ayurveda has been adapted for Western
                consumption, notably by Baba Hari Dass in the 1970s and Maharishi Ayurveda in the 1980s.[17] Historical
                evidence for Ayurvedic texts, terminology and concepts appears from the middle of the first millennium
                BCE onwards.[18]

                In Ayurveda texts, Dosha balance is emphasized, and suppressing natural urges is considered unhealthy
                and claimed to lead to illness.[19] Ayurveda treatises describe three elemental doshas viz. vāta, pitta
                and kapha, and state that balance (Skt. sāmyatva) of the doshas results in health, while imbalance
                (viṣamatva) results in disease. Ayurveda treatises divide medicine into eight canonical components.
                Ayurveda practitioners had developed various medicinal preparations and surgical procedures from at
                least the beginning of the common era.[20]

                There is no good evidence that Ayurveda is effective to treat or cure cancer.[10] Some Ayurvedic
                preparations have been found to contain lead, mercury, and arsenic,[9] substances known to be harmful to
                humans. A 2008 study found the three substances in close to 21% of U.S. and Indian-manufactured patent
                Ayurvedic medicines sold through the Internet.[21] The public health implications of such metallic
                contaminants in India are unknown.[21]
