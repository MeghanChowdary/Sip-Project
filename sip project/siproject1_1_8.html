                        <!-- properties --><b>PROPERTIES</b><br>
                        1)Cholesterol
                        In one study, cumin powder dissolved in yogurt helped reduce “bad” (LDL) cholesterol and
                        triglycerides while increasing “good” (HDL) cholesterol.
                        High LDL cholesterol increases your chances of health problems like heart attack or strokes.
                        High
                        triglyceride levels can make you more likely to have heart problems. HDL helps to supply LDL to
                        liver to flush it out from the body.
                        Several studies have shown that cumin help people control their cholesterol levels. Cumin
                        effectively lowered oxidized LDL cholesterol in patients with already high cholesterol.

                        Type 2 diabetes occurs when a person’s body no longer responds to insulin correctly. This is
                        called
                        insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the movement of blood glucose, or sugar,
                        into cells, which use it as energy. If sugar cannot enter the cells,too much glucose collects in
                        the
                        blood,and body cannot use it as energy.
                        Cyminum supplement in patients with diabetes type II may decrease the serum levels of insulin,
                        FBS,
