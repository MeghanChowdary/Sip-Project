                        <b>Garlic can cure all diseases:</b> Garlic has several health benefits, but it is not a panacea

                        cannot cure all diseases. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a
                        qualified practitioner of traditional medicine for personalized advice and guidance.

                        benefits, but cooking garlic can increase its bioavailability and make it easier to digest.
