                        <!-- properties -->
                        1.The primary active component of turmeric — and the one that gives the spice its characteristic
                        yellow color — is curcumin.
                        Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory effects
                        and is a very strong antioxidant.

                        <br>

                        2.Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound.
                        This anti-inflammatory ability might reduce the aggravation that people with arthritis feel in
                        their joints.
                        <br>

                        3.Oxidative damage is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and many diseases.
                        Turmeric can increase the antioxidant capacity which prevents oxidative damage in body.
                        <br>

                        4.Perhaps the main benefit of curcumin when it comes to heart disease is improving the function
                        of the endothelium, the lining of your blood vessels.
                        The endothelial dysfunction is a major driver of heart disease. This is when your endothelium is
                        unable to regulate blood pressure, blood clotting, and various other factors.
                        <br>

                        5.Glaucoma, a group of eye conditions, is one of the leading causes of blindness in people over
                        age 60.
                        But preliminary research published July 2018 in Scientific Reports shows topical curcumin
                        treatments may help protect the eyes against degeneration.

                        <b>way to use Turmeric</b>
                        <br>
                        <!-- wayofuse -->
                        1)Turmeric – along with ginger – is useful when you have a cold or flu.
                        Being both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, they may offer a much needed relief from coughing
                        and sore throat.
                        <br>

                        2)Fresh root or powder are both excellent for cooking. Don’t forget to always combine them with
                        black pepper to enhance curcumin absorption.
                        However, curcumin is poorly absorbed into your bloodstream. In order to experience the full
                        effects of curcumin, its bioavailability (the rate at which your body absorbs a substance) needs
                        to improve.
                        <br>
                        It helps to consume it with black pepper, which contains piperine. Piperine is a natural
                        substance that enhances the absorption of curcumin by 2,000% .
                        <br>

                        3)Adding turmeric to the milk has been an ancient Ayurvedic practice for healing wounds.
                        It is mostly consumed before going to bed. Heat ½ teaspoon of turmeric paste in two drops of
                        ghee or coconut oil.
                        <br>
                        Add milk to it. While you can have your golden milk as is, adding black pepper to the golden
                        <br>
                        milk will increase the retention of turmeric.
                        You can also add cinnamon powder and honey for sweetness. If you like your nuts and seeds, this
                        may be a good recipe to add a handful of them to the milk.
                        <br>

                        4)For allergies and cold
                        In a table spoon of honey
                        Combine all of these ingredients into 1 tsp. of raw local honey, then eat the honey.
                        *A pinch of turmeric
                        *A pinch of black pepper
                        *A pinch of ginger

                        This flavor-filled spice is primarily cultivated from the rhizomes, or roots, of a flowering
                        plant that grows in India and other parts of Southeast Asia, and aside from giving curry its
                        vibrant yellow color, turmeric is also known for having potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
                        properties.<br>
                        It has been used in India for thousands of years as both a spice and medicinal herb. Like many
                        spices, turmeric (Curcuma longa) has a long history of use in traditional medicine.<br>
                        While turmeric is a flavorsome spice that is nutritious to consume, it has also traditionally
                        been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine to treat inflammatory conditions, skin diseases,
                        wound, and liver conditions.<br>
                        Turmeric is used in Ayurvedic medicine as a digestive healing agent too.<br>
