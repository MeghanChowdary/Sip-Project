                        compounds that may have health benefits. But it may cause some side effects.
                        <br>
                        Bitter melon — also known as bitter gourd or Momordica charantia — is a tropical vine that
                        belongs to the gourd family and is closely related to zucchini, squash, pumpkin, and cucumber.
                        <br>
                        It’s cultivated around the world for its edible fruit, which is considered a staple in many
                        types of Asian cuisine.
                        <br>
                        The Chinese variety is typically long, pale green, and covered with wart-like bumps.
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, the Indian variety is more narrow and has pointed ends with rough, jagged
                        spikes on the rind.
                        <br>
                        In addition to its sharp flavor and distinct appearance, bitter melon has been associated with
                        several impressive health benefits.<br>
