                        <br>
                        <b>Medications: </b>Over-the-counter antihistamines, such as loratadine (Claritin) and
                        cetirizine (Zyrtec), can help relieve symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
                        Nasal sprays, such as fluticasone (Flonase) and cromolyn (NasalCrom), can also help relieve
                        nasal congestion.
                        <br>
                        <b>Allergen immunotherapy:</b> Also known as allergy shots, this treatment involves
                        administering small amounts of the allergen to the individual over time to help build up their
                        tolerance to it.
                        <br>
                        <b>Avoiding allergens: </b>Identifying and avoiding the substances that trigger your allergies
                        can help reduce your symptoms.
                        <br>
                        <b>Saline nasal irrigation:</b> Rinsing the nasal passages with a saline solution can help
                        remove allergens and mucus from the nose.
                        <br>
                        <b>Nasal corticosteroid sprays:</b> These sprays reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and
                        can be effective in reducing symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
                        <br>
                        <b>Natural remedies:</b> Some natural remedies such as local honey, quercetin, and butterbur
                        have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce symptoms of allergies.

                        <br>
                        It's important to note that turmeric can temporarily stain the skin yellow and before applying
                        the mask to face, it is better to do a patch test on small area to check for any adverse
                        reactions. Also, people with sensitive skin should avoid using neem as it may cause irritation.
                        <b>herbal oil</b>

                        Add the licorice root powder, turmeric powder, and neem leaves powder to the boiling water and

                        <br>
                        It's also important to note that while turmeric and neem have anti-inflammatory properties, they
                        can be quite strong and may cause skin irritation or dryness if used too frequently or in high
                        doses.<br> Therefore, it is important to consult a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner for the
                        proper dosage and frequency that's suitable for you.
                        <br>
                        It's always best to patch test a small amount of the mask on your skin before applying it all

                        individual's skin type.
                        <br>
                        In general, the suggested usage is to apply the oil 2-3 times a week, massaging it gently on the
                        affected areas of the skin, and leaving it on for at least 30 minutes before washing it off.
                        <br>
                        It's important to patch test the oil on a small area of skin before applying it all over your
                        body, to check for any adverse reactions.<br> It's also important to note that some herbs used
                        in herbal oils can be quite strong and may cause skin irritation or dryness if used too
                        frequently or in high doses.<br> Therefore, it is important to consult a qualified Ayurvedic

                        The recommended dosage for a kashayam or herbal decoction varies depending on the specific herbs
                        and the individual's health condition. In general, the suggested dosage for a kashayam is
                        usually between 50-100ml, once or twice a day, before or after meals.<br> However, it's
                        important to
                        consult a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner for the proper dosage that's suitable for you, as it
                        may vary based on your age, weight, and other factors.
                        <br>
                        It's also important to note that kashayam should be prepared freshly every time it is consumed,
                        and should not be stored for long. It is best to consume it within 2-3 hours after it is made.
